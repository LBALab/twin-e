# - Brief description -

Welcome to Prequengine project.
This project allows you to play Little Big Adventure 1 (LBA1 for short) game.
It will allow other project modifications to build different games using this engine.

To use it, you just need to copy the application engine and lba.cfg file to LBA1 
(or other projects) game directory to play it. You will need the original game
to play with this engine and also midi_mi_win.hqr file created by LbaWin project
so you can play and listening MIDI files.

# compiling:

You need libSDL, libSDL_Mixer and libSDL_ttf in order to properly compile prequengine.

on GNU/Linux:

After installing the libsdl and libsdl_mixer development packages, go to the trunk/src directory and type "make" (without the quotes, off course). This will compile the source code and create a file caller "prequengine". Copy this file to the same place in your system where you have made a copy of the "lba" directory from the LBA1 CDROM. Also copy the "lba.cfg" file to that location. Go to that dir and type "./prequengine"

If you are a Ubuntu user, the procedure should look like this:

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
cd trunk/src
make
cp ./lba.sfg ~/Desktop/lba/
cp ./prequengine ~/Desktop/lba/
cd ~/Desktop/lba
./prequengine

(supposing that you have made a copy of the LBA1 CDROM's "lba" directory in your Desktop)
