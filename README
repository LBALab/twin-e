# - Brief description -

Welcome to Prequengine project.
This project allows you to play Little Big Adventure 1 (LBA1 for short) game.
It will allow other project modifications to build different games using this engine.

Will be release various public versions during development for testing proposes.
We appreciate everyone's help to fix all the issues the game may have.


# - Not available original features (yet) -

Currently, most of the game features are implemented, the ones that makes you finish the 
entire game. Although, there are still some particulary features not yet implemented:
	- Few AI scripts commands;
	- Show Holomap locations;
	- Play voice samples while displaying text;
	- Show bubble cloud while playing voices without text;
	- Use Meca-Pinguins;
	- Magicball aiming for keys;
	- Finish main menu;
	- Few rendering types;


# - How to use it -

For public releases, you just need to copy all package content to LBA1 (or other projects)
game directory. Some files must be overriden to properly run the application engine.

For the compiled version, you just need to copy the application engine and lba.cfg file 
to LBA1 (or other projects) game directory to play it. You will need the original game
to play with this engine and also midi_mi_win.hqr file created by LbaWin project
so you can play and listening MIDI files (this need to be change in future revisions).


# - High Quality Music - 

All musics in game (midi, CD) can be replace with MP3/OGG files with better sound
quality. 

For CD tracks, just create a folder named "music" and inside all CD tracks 
names like: 1.mp3, 4.mp3, 8.ogg.

For Midi, just create new HQR file with all MP3/OGG files inside. HQR file must 
be named "midi_mi_win_mp3.hqr" or "midi_mi_win_ogg.hqr".


# - Compiling -

You need libSDL, libSDL_Mixer in order to properly compile prequengine.
As addicional for in-game debug you need libSDL_ttf.

# on GNU/Linux:

After installing the libsdl, libsdl_mixer and libsdl_ttf development packages,
go to the trunk/src directory and type "make" (without the quotes, off course).
This will compile the source code and create an executable file called
"prequengine". Copy this file to the same place in your system where you have
made a copy of the "lba" directory from the LBA1 CDROM. Also copy the "lba.cfg"
file to that location. Go to that dir and type "./prequengine"

If you are a Ubuntu user, the procedure should look like this:

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
cd trunk/src
make
cp ./lba.cfg ~/Desktop/lba/
cp ./prequengine ~/Desktop/lba/
cd ~/Desktop/lba
./prequengine

(supposing that you have made a copy of the LBA1 CDROM's "lba" directory in your Desktop)
