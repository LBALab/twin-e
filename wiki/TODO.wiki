#summary Things yet to do.

= Introduction =

This is the place to list every TODO we need to make for this project.


= Details =

  * Refactoring code:
    # Do endian for reading content from pointers for proper portability.
    # Comment and reorganize the code for animation and renderer files
    # Improve Keyboard routines. Its now based in original but will be a mess to port it. Possible way to resolve will still made like original but make a bridge between SDL I/O and LBA I/O.
  * Sound: animations don't have sound yet. Do Animation Actions.
  * Menu: complete other menu options including volume settings
  * Text: finish code to show intro screens in fullscreen.
