#summary Things yet to do.

= Introduction =

This is the place to list every TODO we need to make for this project.


= Details =

  * Improve Keyboard routines. Its now based in original but will be a mess to port it. Possible way to resolve will still made like original but make a bridge between SDL I/O and LBA I/O.
  * Refactoring code:
    # Do endian for reading content from pointers for proper portability.
    # Comment and reorganize the code for animation and renderer files
    # Find better way (file/place) to put all init functions which reset the game state
    # Create new file for movements/direction. Will add code from actor.c and lbaengine.c
    # Rework on engine main loop (get rid of "too many separate functions").
