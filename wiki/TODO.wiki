This is the place to list every TODO we need to make for this project.

  # Do Save/Load routines;
  # Show credits in the end of game or after some seconds in Main Menu;


= In-Game =
 
  # Text: implement bubble hint when text option is disabled;
  # Holomap: create holomap routines;
  # Renderer: implement missing rendering types and fix rendering issues;


= Scripting =

  # Zoom feature; (lZOOM)
  # Dialogue bubble; (lBUBBLE_ON, lBUBBLE_OFF)
  # Vox on say messages; (lSAY_MESSAGE, lSAY_MESSAGE_OBJ)
  # Holomap trajectories (lHOLOMAP_TRAJ)
  # Fade Palette scripts; (lSET_NORMAL_PAL, lSET_DARK_PAL, lFADE_PAL_RED, lFADE_ALARM_RED, lFADE_ALARM_PAL, lFADE_RED_PAL, lFADE_RED_ALARM, lFADE_PAL_ALARM)


= Refactoring =

  # Do endian for reading content from pointers for proper portability;
  # Comment and reorganize the code for renderer and text files;
  # Do a proper resource system, changing each request resource when need it;
  # Do a proper sound system with cached resources. Also save the sample handle to proper stop/pause/resume it. Take the advantage of Channels. Use panning and distance to all samples in scene;
  # Improve Keyboard routines. Its now based in original but can be tricky to port it;
