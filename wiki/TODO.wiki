This is the place to list every TODO we need to make for this project.

  # Complete other menu options including volume settings;
  # Do Save/Load routines;
  # Show credits in the end of game or after some seconds in Main Menu;

  * Finish scripting while doing the following tasks:
  
  # Text: implement bubble hint when text option is disabled;
  # Holomap: create holomap routines;
  # Renderer: implement missing rendering types and fix rendering issues;


= Refactoring =

  # Do endian for reading content from pointers for proper portability;
  # Comment and reorganize the code for renderer and text files;
  # Do a proper resource system, changing each request resource when need it;
  # Do a proper sound system with cached resources. Also save the sample handle to proper stop/pause/resume it. Take the advantage of Channels. Use panning and distance to all samples in scene;
  # Improve Keyboard routines. Its now based in original but can be tricky to port it;
