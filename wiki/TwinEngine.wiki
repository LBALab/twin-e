#summary This page introduces TwinEngine project

= Introduction =

TwinEngine, or twin-e for short, is a LBA opensource reimplementation made by Vincent Hamm (aka yaz0r). Its a completely reverse engineer of the original executables files.

The project can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/twin-e


= Why not improve TwinEngine =

Since TwinEngine was truly done by reversing, its code start to become very difficult to reorganize and improve. Thats why Prequengine project was created. 
Its completely based on TwinEngine, but with the goal to be created from scratch and organize its code, comment code, give better functions and variables names, plus features content to easily allow new LBA game modifications.

At this moment TwinEngine is playable and LBA1 compatible.
