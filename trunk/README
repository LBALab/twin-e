# - Brief description -

Welcome to TwinEngine project.
This project allows you to play Little Big Adventure 1 (LBA1 for short) game.

Will be release various public versions during development for testing proposes.
We appreciate everyone's help to fix all the issues the game may have.

This project was merged with prequengine.


# - Not available original features (yet) -

The game is at beta stage with most the game features implemented. The entire game is compatible
and few features are missing.  
Check the TODO list at https://code.google.com/p/twin-e/wiki/TODO for more informations


# - How to use it -

For public releases, you just need to copy all package content to LBA1 (or other projects)
game directory. Some files must be overriden to properly run the application engine.

For the compiled version, you just need to copy the application engine and lba.cfg file 
to LBA1 game directory to play it. You will need the original game to play with this engine.


# - Compiling -

You need libSDL, libSDL_Mixer in order to properly compile twin-e.
As addicional for in-game debug you'll need libSDL_ttf.


# on GNU/Linux:

After installing the libsdl, libsdl_mixer and libsdl_ttf development packages,
go to the trunk/src directory and type "make" (without the quotes, off course).
This will compile the source code and create an executable file called
"twin-e". Copy this file to the same place in your system where you have
made a copy of the "lba" directory from the LBA1 CDROM. Also copy the "lba.cfg"
file to that location. Go to that dir and type "./twin-e"

If you are a Ubuntu user, the procedure should look like this:

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
cd trunk/src
make
cp ./lba.cfg ~/Desktop/lba/
cp ./twin-e ~/Desktop/lba/
cd ~/Desktop/lba
./twin-e

(supposing that you have made a copy of the LBA1 CDROM's "lba" directory in your Desktop)
